This was a tuto given by UCSB gaucho game lab [Tuto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1gFDnrTOEo) to introduce to unity and c# to a group of students. The goal was to get them to create a simple asteroid game. The code is a bit messy, but it was a first attempt and it got the job done.

It might need some cleaning up and refactoring, but it should give you an idea of how to create a simple game in unity using c#. The main things to focus on are the asteroid class, the player class , and the game manager class.
